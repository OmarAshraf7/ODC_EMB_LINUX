#Explain the differences between standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr)

Standard Output (stdout): Used for normal program output, with file descriptor 1,
displayed on the terminal or redirected.
Standard Error (stderr): Used for error messages,
with file descriptor 2, also displayed on the terminal or redirected separately.
stdout and stderr are separate to distinguish normal output from errors but can be combined.
File descriptors: 0 for stdin, 1 for stdout, 2 for stderr.
